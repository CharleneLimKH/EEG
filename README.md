<h1>Objective</h1>
The objective of this project is to develop a digital biomarker using EEG data that can accurately identify individuals with eye disorders characterized by the need for long and stronger blinks. Students will analyze EEG signals obtained from four electrodes to find a biomarker that can be used to diagnose this eye disorder efficiently.
